I am currently a teaching assistant for the Introduction to Ecology field lab (EBIO 2040) at CU Boulder, where I teach students the basics of experimental design, coding in R, and interpreting scientific results. I have also given two guest lectures for Conservation Planning (4560/5560) at CU Boulder. Additionally, I have experience with outdoor educational programs; at Cornell, I taught courses focused on backpacking, nature exploration and team building.
