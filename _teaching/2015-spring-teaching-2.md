I actively engage with community decision makers in my research. While working as a fellow for the city of Boulder, I engaged with stakeholders involved in planning climate change adaptation and mitigation measures for the city, and integrated those decisions into my research on urban heat islands (UHIs). Additionally, I am a founding member of the Front Range Urban Heat Research consortium, which focuses on regional-scale solutions to UHI impacts.
