I am a PhD candidate in the Dee Lab in the Department of Ecology & Evolutionary Biology at University of Colorado, Boulder. 

I study the impacts of global change on plant communities and ecosystem functioning, with a particular focus on drought effects on grasslands. I leverage remote sensing to map and explore variation in diversity and plant traits across space and time.
