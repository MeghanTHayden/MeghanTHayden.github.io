I am a PhD candidate in the [Dee Lab](https://www.colorado.edu/ebio/laura-dee) in the [Department of Ecology & Evolutionary Biology](https://www.colorado.edu/ebio/) at University of Colorado, Boulder. 

I study the impacts of global change on plant communities and ecosystem functioning in a variety of systems, including 1) drought effects on global grasslands, and 2) impacts of invasive alien trees in the fynbos biome of South Africa. I leverage remote sensing to map and explore variation in diversity and plant traits across space and time.
