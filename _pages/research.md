Biodiversity & ecosystem functioning
======

I am broadly interested in the impact of global change on biodiversity and in developing novel methods for monitoring, characterizing and exploring variation in biodiversity across space and time. I extend this research to consider human valuation of functioning, in the form of ecosystem services, and how we manage for them across a landscape. I address these topics in grassland and urban systems.

Functional Traits & Remote sensing
======

I use functional traits to understand community response to change and impacts to ecosystem functioning. I employ novel methods in remote sensing and hyperspectral imagery to characterize community traits, and focus on formulating predictive frameworks for impacts of global change on ecosystem processes.

I am currently a graduate research assistant on a project funded by NASA's BioSCape, which seeks to leverage airborne hyperspectral imagery to map functional diversity across landscapes.

Global change
======

Lastly, I am interested in employing causal inference techniques to better understand the implications of global change to better inform policy and decision making at local to regional scales. 

My work with BioSCape explores how invasive alien trees influence biodiversity and water resources in the Greater Cape Floristic Region of South Africa. Tying the above themes together, I use remote sensing to map and understand the impacts of invasion.
